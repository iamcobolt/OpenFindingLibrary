# Risk Rating Definitions

This file describes how the subjective risk has been calculated. If your organisation is using the accompanied risk rating included in the finding it should be based off these definitions.

---

## Critical - 5

A Critical threat ranking requires immediate remediation or mitigation. Exploitation of critical ranked vulnerabilities typically requires a minimal amount of effort by the attacker but poses a significant threat to an organization’s application or networking environments. Critical ranked vulnerabilities typically lead to compromise of multiple assets, sensitive information, or accounts in the case of application security. Critical severity threats are within the ThreatIndex range of 9.1 to 10.0.

## High - 4
A High threat ranking requires immediate remediation or mitigation. Exploitation of high ranked vulnerabilities typically requires a minimal amount of effort by the attacker but poses a significant threat to an organization’s application or networking environments. High ranked vulnerabilities typically lead to compromise of a single asset, limited sensitive information, or account in the case of application security. High severity threats are within the ThreatIndex range of 7.0 to 9.0.

## Medium - 3
A High threat ranking requires immediate remediation or mitigation. Exploitation of high ranked vulnerabilities typically requires a minimal amount of effort by the attacker but poses a significant threat to an organization’s application or networking environments. High ranked vulnerabilities typically lead to compromise of a single asset, limited sensitive information, or account in the case of application security. High severity threats are within the ThreatIndex range of 7.0 to 9.0.

## Low - 2
A Low threat ranking requires remediation or mitigation once all critical, high, and medium threat vulnerabilities have been resolved. Low ranked vulnerabilities typically leak information to unauthorized or anonymous users and may be used to launch more targeted attack against the application or network environment. Low severity threats are within the ThreatIndex range of 2.0 to 3.9.

## Info - 1
An Informational threat ranking presents no direct threat to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the data or systems supporting the environment. These issues pose a fundamentally low threat, or may pose no threat all, to the organization and any proposed resolution should be considered as an addition to relatively effective security controls already in place. Informational severity threats are within the ThreatIndex range of 0.0 to 1.9.

## Best Practice Deviation - 0
A Best Practice Deviation rating denotes a deviation from best practice that is not security related. This finding identifies and recommends improvements with no security concern but where the organization does not follow best practices.

## Effective Defense - 0
An Informational threat ranking presents no direct threat to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the data or systems supporting the environment. These issues pose a fundamentally low threat, or may pose no threat all, to the organisation and any proposed resolution should be considered as an addition to relatively effective security controls already in place. Informational severity threats are within the ThreatIndex range of 0.0 to 1.9.
